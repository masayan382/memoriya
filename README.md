This to-do list is automatically added when you create an item. If you check it, the color will change. And if you press the trash button they will be erased. In addition, there is also a search function.

You can create a to-do list on My Page after you create an account.
There are login, logout, profile editing and password reminder functions. You can also delete your account from the unsubscribe button.
